<p>I have two awesome little cats that live with me at home. Two sister's that
  my girlfriend Amber found and rescued; after Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston's streets
  in 2017. Momo and Ryo are both 1 year old with their birthdate around August 25 2017.
  Momo has orange fur and white paws, and her sister Ryo has a pale golden fur coat.
  They both love to play with strings and chase after dragonflies out in the grassy yard.
  When they get excited they speed around and when they intentionally or unintentionally
  sneak up on each other; their fur stands on end and poofs out all around!</p>
